## Hey! I'm Dave. Welcome to my GitHub.

My first _"Hello World"_ was written in Java, which remains my favorite language. Backend is my domain expertise, but I've grown quite fond of front-end, particularly React. I am a full-stack developer with a couple years worth of experience and eager to gain more.

If I'm not working (_currently a Software Engineer for Target_), I'm most likely spending time with my wife and kids.

### Tech Stack:

Back-End:
Java, Kotlin, SQL, JSON, Groovy, Spring 

Front-End: 
React, TypeScript, Redux, NextJS, Angular, JavaScript

Methodologies & Tools:
REST APIs, Test Driven Development (_Unit, Integration_), Pair Programming, Agile (_Scrum & Kanban_), DBeaver (_MySQL, OracleSQL, PostgreSQL_), Flyway Migrations, Amazon S3, Docker, Design (_UI/UX & Backend Architecture_)
