# Hey there!   I'm David Estrada, _Full Stack Developer_

![Paddling](/images/hiking.jpeg)

#### My first Hello world was written in Java and as such, remains my favorite and strongest language. I am a full stack developer: I have experience using SQL, as well as a couple databases and I have a comfortable grasp on JavaScript, including several of its frameworks. Iâ€™m open to work and projects, so feel free to reach out!

### Here's my [_Portfolio_](https://dave-estrada.com/). You can also email me at _destrada2193@gmail.com_

#### If I'm not coding away, I'm most likely spending quality time with my wife and daughter or out hiking with our dog. Below are some links as well for reaching out. Don't be shy!
