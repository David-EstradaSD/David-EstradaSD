## I'm Dave. Welcome to my GitHub!

My first _Hello world_ was written in Java and as such, remains my favorite language. I am a full-stack developer with experience using SQL, as well as a couple databases and I have a comfortable grasp on JavaScript, including several of its frameworks. 

If I'm not coding away, I'm most likely spending quality time with my wife and daughter or out hiking with our dog. I’m open to work and projects, so feel free to reach out!
