## Hey! I'm Dave. Welcome to my GitHub.

My first _"Hello World"_ was written in Java and as such, remains my favorite language. However, I've grown quite fond of front-end technologies, particularly React. I am a full-stack developer with experience using SQL, a couple of different databases and JavaScript (_including several of its frameworks_).

If I'm not working (_currently a Software Engineer for Target_), I'm most likely hiking.

### Tech Stack:

Back-End:
Java, SQL, JSON, Elasticsearch, Spring (Boot, MVC, Data), JPA, JDBC

Front-End: 
React, TypeScript, Redux, NextJS, Angular, JavaScript, CSS, HTML

Methodologies & Tools:
Git, REST APIs, Test Driven Development, Pair Programming, Agile (_Scrum & Kanban_), Postman, MySQL, OracleSQL, PostgreSQL
