## Hey! I'm Dave. Welcome to my GitHub.

My first _"Hello World"_ was written in Java and as such, remains my favorite language; however, I'm growing quite fond of front-end frameworks and libraries, particularly React. I am a full-stack developer with experience using SQL, a couple of different databases and JavaScript (_including several of its frameworks_). You can find out more at my [_portfolio_](https://dave-estrada.com/).

If I'm not coding away, I'm most likely at the beach or hiking with my dog. Iâ€™m open to work and projects, so feel free to reach out!
