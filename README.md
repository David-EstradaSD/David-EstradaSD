## I'm Dave. Welcome to my GitHub!

My first _Hello world_ was written in Java and as such, remains my favorite language. I am a full-stack developer with experience using SQL, a couple databases and JavaScript (_including several of its frameworks_). 

If I'm not coding away, I'm most likely at the beach or hiking with my dog. Iâ€™m open to work and projects, so feel free to reach out!
